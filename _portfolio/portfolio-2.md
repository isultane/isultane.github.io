The text ML project is built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to easily upload and process their l
abeled text data in Excel format, and provides a range of options for selecting a test size and choosing from various ML algorithms. The project is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to analyze their text data using machine learning techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this project can help you effectively analyze and understand your text data. 

In addition to providing a range of options for analyzing text data using machine learning techniques, the text ML project also includes visualization tools to help users understand the accuracy of the validated ML algorithms. After selecting an algorithm and running the analysis, the system will visualize  the results and display the accuracy of the chosen algorithm. This can be useful for helping users understand the strengths and limitations of different algorithms, and can help them make informed decisions about which techniques are most suitable for their needs. The project also provides the option to print the results to the user, making it easy to review and analyze the data in more detail.
