**Abstract:** vulnerability reports play an important role in
the software maintenance domain. Disclosing vulnerabilities
that attackers can exploit depends on the time of mitigating that
software vulnerability. The information on vulnerability reports
reported by several security scanning software tools facilitates
vulnerability management, trends, and secure software
development automation. Tagging of vulnerability reports with
vulnerability type has thus far been performed manually.
Therefore, human-induced errors and scalability issues suffered
due to the shortage of security experts. This paper introduces a
tool called Vulnerability Report Tagger (VrT), which leverages
machine-learning strategies on vulnerability descriptions for
automatically labeling NVD vulnerability reports. VrT
automatically predicts the cybersecurity labels to assign to
vulnerability text to encourage the use of labeling mechanisms
in vulnerability reporting systems to facilitate the vulnerability
management and prioritization process. Along with the
presentation of the tool architecture and usage, we also evaluate
our tool effectiveness in performing the vulnerabilities
classification (i.e., tagging) process. Link to the tool:
