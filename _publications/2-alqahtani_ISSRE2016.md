**Abstract:** The globalization of the software industry has introduced a widespread use of system components across traditional system boundaries. Due to this global reuse, also vulnerabilities and security concerns are no longer limited in their scope to individual systems but instead can now affect global software ecosystems. While known vulnerabilities and security concerns are reported in specialized vulnerability databases, these repositories often remain information silos. In this research, we introduce a modeling approach, which eliminates these silos by linking security knowledge with other software artifacts to improve traceability and trust in software products. In our approach, we introduce a Security Vulnerabilities Analysis Framework (SV-AF) to support evidence based vulnerability detection. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of our presented approach. In these case studies, we link the NVD vulnerability databases and the Maven build repository to trace vulnerabilities across repository and project boundaries. In our analysis, we identify that 750 Maven project releases are directly affected by known security vulnerabilities and by considering transitive dependencies, an additional 415604 Maven projects can be identified as potentially affected by these vulnerabilities.
