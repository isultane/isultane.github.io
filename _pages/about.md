Sultan Alqahtani is a  assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://units.imamu.edu.sa/colleges/en/ComputerAndInformation/Pages/default.aspx) at [Imam University](https://imamu.edu.sa/Pages/default.aspx). Prior to joining Al Imam University, he obtained his Ph.D. in Software Engineering from Concordia University supervised by [Dr. Juergen Rilling](https://sites.google.com/view/juergenrilling/home). He received his MSc. in Computer Science and Information Security from Concordia University.

His research interests and expertise are in Software Engineering and Secuity, with a special interest in Semantic modeling in Software Engineering (e.,g. software repositories modeling), Software vulnerabilities analysis, Mining Software Repositories, and Software Ecosystems. In particular, he leverages historical project data and applies Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Statistical Analysis techniques in order to better understand what and how software practitioners use the vulnerble software components, and build tools and techniques to help them effectively avoid vulnerability exploitation.
